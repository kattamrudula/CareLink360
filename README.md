### **Project Description: CareLink 360**

**Project Title:** CareLink 360: A Unified, Intelligent Healthcare Information Portal 

** üè• Problem Statement**

In the modern healthcare ecosystem, critical patient information‚Äîsuch as X-rays, diagnostic reports, and prescriptions‚Äîis often siloed across disparate systems and cloud storage services (e.g., OneDrive, Google Drive, AWS S3). This fragmentation creates significant hurdles for medical professionals and patients, impeding timely access to vital health data, hindering collaborative care, and slowing down diagnostic processes. The absence of a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform for accessing and managing this scattered information is a critical challenge. 

** üåê Solution**

CareLink 360 is a web-based application designed to solve this problem by providing a secure, single-pane-of-glass solution for searching, viewing, and managing healthcare content. Our platform integrates with various cloud storage services and hospital databases, creating a unified portal for healthcare professionals, patients, and administrators. 

**Key Features and Technology Stack**

*   üîí **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** We use **Descope Flows** to provide a robust and seamless authentication experience, including social login and multi-factor authentication (MFA). This ensures that only authorized users can access the platform and their specific data. 
*   ü§ñ **Intelligent Content Retrieval:** The core of our solution leverages **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** to create specialized AI agents. Each agent is designed to connect to and intelligently navigate a specific data source (e.g., a hospital's database, a Google Drive folder). 
*   üîë **Descope Outbound Apps for Secure Connections:** Each Google ADK agent uses **Descope Outbound Apps** as a secure "token vault." Instead of hardcoding API keys or managing complex OAuth flows, the agents retrieve a temporary, scoped token from Descope, which they then use to access the respective cloud storage service (OneDrive, Google Drive, Azure Storage, AWS S3, etc.). This architecture ensures that sensitive credentials are never exposed in the agent's code, simplifying development and significantly enhancing security. 
*   üìÑ **Rich Content Preview:** The platform provides a powerful preview feature that allows users to view images (e.g., X-rays) and PDF documents (e.g., diagnostic reports) directly within the application, eliminating the need to download files and switch between applications.

** üåü Impact and Vision**

CareLink 360 aims to streamline data access for the healthcare industry, reducing administrative overhead and improving the quality of patient care. By centralizing information and leveraging AI agents for intelligent data discovery, we can help doctors make faster, more informed decisions. In the future, we plan to expand the functionality to include AI-driven diagnostic assistance and automated report generation, further solidifying CareLink 360 as an indispensable tool for healthcare professionals worldwide.
